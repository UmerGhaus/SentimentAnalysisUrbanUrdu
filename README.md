# Sentiment Analysis in Urban Urdu

This project focuses on sentiment analysis for Urban Urdu, a language variant that incorporates Roman Urdu, English words, and local slang. The goal is to create a machine learning model capable of analyzing sentiment in Urban Urdu texts, addressing challenges like code-switching, diverse spellings, and informal vocabulary.

## Key Features

- **Language-Specific Preprocessing**: Tailored text preprocessing pipeline to handle Urban Urdu's unique linguistic structure, including stopword removal and text normalization.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes a pre-trained model and vectorizer to classify sentiments into Positive, Neutral, and Negative categories.
- **Custom Stopword List**: A curated list of Roman Urdu stopwords is used to improve text cleaning and sentiment prediction accuracy.
- **Flask-Based Interface**: A web application built using Flask for easy interaction and input-output display.

## Objectives

- Enhance the accuracy of sentiment analysis models for underrepresented language variants like Urban Urdu.
- Address specific challenges posed by mixed-language texts, informal grammar, and slang.
- Provide a user-friendly platform for sentiment classification.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Text lowercasing.
   - Removal of punctuation, numbers, and stopwords.
   - Use of a tailored stopword list for Urban Urdu.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Machine learning model trained on Urban Urdu datasets.
   - Feature extraction using vectorization techniques.

3. **Prediction and Analysis**:
   - Real-time sentiment prediction for user-provided text inputs.
   - Classification into Positive, Neutral, and Negative sentiments.

## Applications
